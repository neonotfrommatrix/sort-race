- Contents:
  - assets folder containing:
    race.js
    style.js
  - README.txt
  - quicksort.cpp
  - race.html
  - race.js
  
  
  - External Requirements: None
  
  - Setup and Installation (if any)
  
  - Sample invocation: 3 grids using step functions to see which algorithm sorts the fastest
  
  - Bugs (if any): None

How to handle the JS-2 files to get results:

1. Main HTML file is js-1.html, a web page.
2. Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "assets".
  (You can move this folder elsewhere if you change js-1.html accordingly.)
3. Web page links to (loads) assets/styles.css, a very simple CSS file.
4. Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.
5. After body, web page loads a script file from assets with fcns.
6. After that, another Script section defines another function.
7. And then runs some "loose" Javascript commands.

How to show (and run) the web page:
8. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.

(*) Key: use fcn key F12 to open a "javascript console" in your browser
and see what might be going wrong: errors and warnings.
